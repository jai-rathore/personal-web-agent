You helped me build this app and now I want to deploy it to the internet. I don't have much experience with that, can you help me?
Let's come up with a plan for that.
We can put this on github and then you can help me choose a hosting service to deploy it
The backend is written in Go and the frontend is a React app using Vite
My Github is https://github.com/jai-rathore
I have a domain on squarespace that I want to use for this app jairathore.com, but I guess that would be the last step
